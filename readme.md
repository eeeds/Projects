1. <ins> SQL Data Exploration </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Use SQL, don't be scared, do queries and don't be a pandas dependent.
* This project was queried on PostgreSQL.
* This project is about covid-data exploration. Looking for simples KPIs as Tocal Cases/Population, Percent of People vaccinated, etc.


2. <ins> Explanatory Data Analysis and Data Presentation </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Pandas is maybe the most powerful library for  data science and a must for all of the Data Scientist.
* In this project I work on a movies dataset and I do some data exploration and transformation using the popular python library "Pandas".

3. <ins> Classification model using Apache Spark </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Why spark? Spark DataFrame is distributed and hence processing in the Spark DataFrame is faster for a large amount of data. Spark DataFrames are excellent for building a scalable application.
* In this project, I make a model classification using Apache Spark. 
* I use decision tree as classifier to predict days with low humidity.

4. <ins> Power BI-Personal Finance report </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Power BI is an amazing BI tool for data exploration, transformation, use Power BI and increase your productivity doing incredible things.
* In this project I work on a personal finance report.
