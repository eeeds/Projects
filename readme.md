## Description
---
* This repo contains projects done which applies principles in data engineering and data science. 

## Projects
---
1. <ins> SQL Data Exploration </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Use SQL, don't be scared, do queries and don't be a pandas dependent.
* This project was queried on PostgreSQL.
* This project is about covid-data exploration. Looking for simples KPIs as Tocal Cases/Population, Percent of People vaccinated, etc.


2. <ins> Explanatory Data Analysis and Data Presentation </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Pandas is maybe the most powerful library for  data science and a must for all of the Data Scientist.
* In this project I work on a movies dataset and I do some data exploration and transformation using the popular python library "Pandas".

3. <ins> Classification model using Apache Spark </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Why spark? Spark DataFrame is distributed and hence processing in the Spark DataFrame is faster for a large amount of data. Spark DataFrames are excellent for building a scalable application.
* In this project, I make a model classification using Apache Spark. 
* I use decision tree as classifier to predict days with low humidity.

4. <ins> Power BI-Personal Finance report </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Power BI is an amazing BI tool for data exploration, transformation, use Power BI and increase your productivity doing incredible things.
* In this project I work on a personal finance report.


## Other Projects
* <ins> [GOOGLE-CLOUD-DATA-EXTRACTION](https://github.com/ntaxus/GOOGLE-CLOUD-DATA-EXTRACTION) </ins> :white_check_mark:
* This ETL process extract data from Google Big Query and then clean it to finally save it into a MSS DB.

* <ins> [PROCESO-ETL-SFTP-A-MSSQL-](https://github.com/ntaxus/PROCESO-ETL-SFTP-A-MSSQL-) </ins> :white_check_mark:
* This ETL process extract data from a SFTP, clean it and then loading into a MSS DB.

* <ins> [SEND-MULTIPLE-REPORTS-POWER-BI-RPA](https://github.com/eeeds/SEND-MULTIPLE-REPORTS-POWER-BI-RPA) </ins> :white_check_mark:
* UiPath is a a powerful RPA software, in this project we work with it as a orchestator for a ETL process where the data is extracting from Power Bi as pdfs, then we make some transformations. Finally, we send the final report using email.

* <ins> [BNA-BANK-SCRAPER](https://github.com/eeeds/BNA-BANK-SCRAPER) </ins> :white_check_mark:
* This project is a web scrapper. I use libraries such as bs4 and requests.
* This scraper takes the dolar value from BNA (Banco Nacional de Buenos Aires) and converts it to Argentine Peso (ARS)

* <ins> [Voice-Assistant-in-Python](https://github.com/eeeds/Voice-Assistant-in-Python) </ins> :white_check_mark:
* Virtual Assistant in Python. It works with different libraries to emulate the behavior of different VA's offered in the market such as Alexa, Siri, Cortana, etc.
